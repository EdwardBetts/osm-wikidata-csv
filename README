Tool for adding wikidata tags to OpenStreetMap

This tool expects a CSV file with three fields wikidata, OSM type and OSM ID.
It'll open a changeset, add the wikidata tag to each object, then close the
changeset.

To use the tool you first need to set your username and password in the config
file. You can also set the comment that is posted on the changeset in the
config file.

Run the upload tool from the command line with the name as the CSV as the first
argument.

Example:

$ ./upload.py divisions_of_kannur.csv
